Hello everyone, this is a basic project to send security alert messages to your phone number whenever someone opens your home's locker.
The Bolt IoT WiFi Module is the heart of this project. Basically, this project is based upon the basics of Machine Learning algorithm, 
known as the Z-score Analysis. It is like whenever an anomaly is detected in the readings recorded by the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
sensor, a quick SMS request is done and an SMS is received on your phone number. A LDR is basically a sensor which records the light 
intensity value. It sends the value to the Bolt Cloud, and the required output is shown depending upon the program running behind. 
In this project I have also connected a buzzer to the Bolt WiFi Module to give it a more realistic approach. As soon as an anomaly in 
the data is detected, an SMS alert would be sent as well as the buzzer would start ringing for a few seconds.
